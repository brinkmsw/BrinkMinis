# BrinkMinis
Over five years I start painted minatures as a hobby.  It didn't take me long to fall in love with the hobby, and get to the point where I was submitting pieces in competitions.  As an exercise for web design and to give myself a platform to post I bought the domain BrinkMinis.com and decided to use it to post pictures as well as potential advertise comission painting.
